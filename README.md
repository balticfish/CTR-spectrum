# CTR-spectrum
CTR Spectrum is a small toolbox for coherent transition radiation (CTR) spectral-angular content calculation

The method of calculation is described in our conference paper "Coherent Transition Radiation Generated from Transverse Electron Density Modulation", IPAC2018, Vancouver, Canada (http://inspirehep.net/record/1677406/files/thpmk023.pdf).

It includes both transverse and longitudinal charge contributions in comparison to the convetional 1D longitudinal approach. The conducting plate assumed to be infinite and can have any orientation in XYZ space (defined by its normal vector).

User can run planar and 2D spectral angular scans of the spectrum with scan_theta.py or scan_theta_phi.py respectively.
